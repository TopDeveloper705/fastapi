## FastAPI features

**FastAPI** gives you the following:

* Automatic API documentation with the open standard: <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification" target="_blank"><strong>OpenAPI</strong></a>.
* Automatic data model documentation with <a href="http://json-schema.org/" target="_blank"><strong>JSON Schema</strong></a> (as OpenAPI itself is based on JSON Schema).
* Interactive API documentation and exploration web user interface with <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui" target="_blank"><strong>Swagger UI</strong></a>.

* Alternative API documentation with <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc" target="_blank"><strong>ReDoc</strong></a>.

![ReDoc](img/index/index-06-redoc-02.png)


* All based on standard **Python 3.6 type** declarations (thanks to Pydantic). No new syntax to learn:

```Python
from typing import List, Dict
from datetime import date

from pydantic import BaseModel

# Declare a variable as an str
# and get editor support inside the function
def main(user_id: str):
    return user_id


# A Pydantic model
class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    joined: date
```

That can then be used like:

```Python
my_user: User = User(id=3, name="John Doe", joined="2018-07-19")

second_user_data = {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Mary",
    "joined": "2018-11-30",
}


# **second_user_data means: 
# pass the keys and values of the dict 
# directly as key-value arguments
# equivalent to:
# id=4, name="Mary", joined="2018-11-30"
my_second_user: User = User(**second_user_data)
```

* Sensible **defaults** for everything, with optional configurations everywhere.
* Validation for many **data types**, including:
    * JSON objects (`dict`).
    * JSON array (`list`) defining item types.
    * String (`str`) fields, defining min and max lengths.
    * Numbers (`int`, `float`) with min and max values, etc.
* Security and authentication included: all the security schemes defined in OpenAPI, including:
    * HTTP Basic.
    * **OAuth2** (also with **JWT tokens**)
    * API keys, etc. 
* Plus the security features from Starlette (including session cookies). 
* All built as reusable tools and components that are easy to integrate with your systems, data stores, databases, etc.
* Extremely easy, but extremely powerful <abbr title='also known as "components", "resources", "services", "providers"'><strong>Dependency Injection</strong></abbr> system:
    * Even dependencies can have dependencies, creating a hierarchy or **"graph" of dependencies**.
    * All **automatically handled** by the framework. 
    * All the dependencies can **augment the endpoint** parameters and constraints.
    * **Automatic validation** even for parameters from dependencies.
    * Support for complex user authentication systems, **database connections**, etc.
* **No compromise** with databases, frontends, etc. But easy integration with all.
* **Unlimited "plug-ins"**:
    * Or in other way, no need for them, import and use the code you need. 
    * Any integration is designed to be so simple to use (with dependencies) that you can create a "plug-in" for your application in 2 lines of code using the same structure and syntax as for your endpoints.
* Fully compatible with (and based on) **Starlette**.
    * Any additional Starlette code you have, will also work.
* Fully compatible with (and based on) **Pydantic**. 
    * Any additional Pydantic code you have will also work.
    * Including external libraries also based on Pydantic, as <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper">ORM</abbr>s, <abbr title="Object-Document Mapper">ODM</abbr>s for databases.
* 100% test coverage (* not yet, in a couple days).
* 100% type annotated code base.

## Starlette features

Plus **Starlette**'s features (FastAPI is just Starlette on steroids):

* Seriously impressive performance. It is <a href="https://github.com/encode/starlette#performance" target="_blank">one of the fastest Python frameworks available, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go**</a>.
* **WebSocket** support.
* **GraphQL** support.
* In-process background tasks.
* Startup and shutdown events.
* Test client built on `requests`.
* **CORS**, GZip, Static Files, Streaming responses.
* **Session and Cookie** support.
* 100% test coverage.
* 100% type annotated codebase.

## Pydantic features

Plus **Pydantic**'s features:

* **No brainfuck**: 
    * No new schema definition micro-language to learn.
    * If you know Python types you know how to use Pydantic.
* Plays nicely with your **IDE/linter/brain**:
    * Because pydantic data structures are just instances of classes you define; auto-completion, linting, mypy and your intuition should all work properly with your validated data.
* **Fast**:
    * in <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/#benchmarks-tag" target="_blank">benchmarks</a> Pydantic is faster than all other tested libraries.
* Validate **complex structures**:
    * Use of hierarchical Pydantic models, Python `typing`â€™s `List` and `Dict`, etc.
    * And validators allow complex data schemas to be clearly and easily defined, checked and documented as JSON Schema.
    * You can have deeply **nested JSON** objects and have them all validated and annotated.
* **Extendible**:
    * Pydantic allows custom data types to be defined or you can extend validation with methods on a model decorated with the validator decorator.
